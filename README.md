# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Stop-and-Go Wave Mitigation

This repository contains the implementation of a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning system for mitigating stop-and-go waves in traffic flow, as described in our research paper.

## Overview

We train autonomous vehicles using deep reinforcement learning to stabilize traffic flow on a circular road. Each vehicle learns an individual policy to maintain safe distances while achieving desired velocities, leading to emergent cooperative strategies that suppress stop-and-go oscillations.

### Key Features

- **Multi-agent setup**: 15-25 vehicles with independent RL policies
- **Ring road topology**: Circular 220m track inspired by the Sugiyama experiment
- **PPO algorithm**: Proximal Policy Optimization with 3-layer neural network
- **Robust training**: Random perturbations and sensor noise during training
- **Safety-first approach**: Progressive reward zones and collision avoidance
